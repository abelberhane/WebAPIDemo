# Web API Demo

My first attempt at working with an API. Developed a Demo Web API. I followed a Tutorial from C# Corner that explained the reasoning behind 
the settings and what they mean. This was a simple project and opened my eyes to the uses and how lightweight you could make some applications
with just that parsed text. Very interesting.
